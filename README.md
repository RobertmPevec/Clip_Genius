# 🏆 Scoreboard Analyzer AI

## 🎯 Problem Addressed
Addressing the lack of visibility and limited coverage for lesser-known sports leagues and women's sports. Gen Z demands shorter, engaging, and easily shareable content.

## ✨ Our Solution
- Automatically processes video footage using **OpenCV** and **PyTesseract OCR** to accurately detect and track scoreboard changes.
- Utilizes **NLP (NeMo, NVIDIA)** to analyze commentary and rank clips by excitement level.
- Enhances video production efficiency using parallel processing with **FFmpeg**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Score Tracking**: Precisely extracts scoreboard data from diverse footage.
- **Commentary Analysis**: Identifies exciting moments using NLP and ranks content for maximum viewer engagement.
- **Cost & Time Efficient**: Saves up to 14 hours per project by automating the editing process.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- OpenCV
- PyTesseract OCR
- NLP (NeMo, NVIDIA)
- FFmpeg
- FAISS Vector Database

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Incorporate pose detection and object tracking for advanced analytics.
- Expand event recognition to include assists, rebounds, steals, and defensive actions.
- Broaden training dataset for improved accuracy and reduced misclassification.
