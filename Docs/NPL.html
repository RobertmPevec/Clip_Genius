    <h1>CLIP GENIUS: NPL UNIT</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In today’s fast-paced digital world, videos have become a primary medium for sharing information, ideas, and
        stories.
        However, with the increasing volume of video content, identifying the most important and relevant moments can be
        a
        time-consuming and challenging task. Our software is designed to simplify this process by leveraging advanced
        technology
        to analyze and highlight the key parts of a video based on what’s being said. Think of it as having an
        intelligent
        assistant that listens to your video and guides you directly to the moments that matter most.</p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>
            <p><strong>Audio Extraction</strong>: We begin by isolating the audio track from your video, preparing it
                for
                analysis. This step is akin to extracting the soundtrack from a movie, ensuring the audio is ready for
                further processing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Chunk Splitting</strong>: To handle lengthy audio files, we divide the audio into smaller,
                manageable
                segments. This approach is similar to breaking a large book into chapters, making it easier to process
                and
                analyze.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Speech-to-Text Transcription</strong>: Using NVIDIA’s NeMo ASR model, we convert the spoken words
                in
                each audio segment into text. This powerful tool acts like a virtual transcriber, accurately turning
                speech
                into written form.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Semantic Analysis</strong>: Finally, we analyze the transcribed text to identify the most
                important
                parts. By comparing the text against predefined topics or keywords, such as “machine learning,” we
                pinpoint
                the segments that are most relevant to your needs.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>The application is designed to automatically generate video highlights from a given video file. It uses advanced
        technologies like speech recognition, semantic analysis, and video processing to identify and extract the most
        relevant
        segments of the video. The highlights are then compiled into a shorter, engaging video.</p>
    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Languages</strong>: Python.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Libraries</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>FFmpeg for audio/video processing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>NVIDIA NeMo for speech-to-text transcription.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sentence Transformers for text embeddings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>FAISS for similarity search.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: Concurrent.futures for efficient chunk processing.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: Used multi-threading to speed up transcription and embedding tasks.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Efficient Storage</strong>: Deletes temporary files (e.g., audio chunks) after processing to save
                disk
                space.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Test Case</strong>: Verify that the application successfully converts a 15-minute video into a
                10-minute highlights video by removing unnecessary parts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
            <ul start="1">
                <li>
                    <p>Upload a 15-minute video file.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Expected Result</strong>: The output video is of reduced length, containing only the
                most
                relevant segments from the original video.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Outcome</strong>: <strong>Successfully converted a 15-minute video into a 10-minute highlights
                    video
                    after removing unnecessary parts.</strong> The application accurately identified and retained the
                key
                moments while discarding less relevant content.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Future Enhancements</h4>
    <ul start="1">
        <li>
            <p><strong>Customizable Highlight Length</strong>: Allow users to specify the desired length of the
                highlights
                video.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Extend transcription capabilities to support multiple languages.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Cloud Integration</strong>: Enable processing of videos stored in cloud storage (e.g., Google
                Drive,
                Dropbox).</p>
